1.) Burp Suite download & Installation:-
	- Download the Burp suite and open it on default setting
A) Proxy Tab:-
	- Proxy Tab> Goto proxy tab > checked intercept is "ON" >
	- Option Tab> Proxy listener already checked the defualt proxy i.e 127.0.0.1:8080
	- If you want to test on secure site "HTTPS" then download the CA burp certificate which export from BURP and import into 
	Browser
	- Click on import/export for download Certificate and rename extension ".der"
	- Import the Burp CA certificate into Browser Certificate> Manage Certificate > Authorities > Import Our BURP CA 
	(As as PortSwigger)
	-  We can change any from BURP.

B) Target & Spider:-
	i) Target:-  Target is basically set the target or structure when we visit the site
		- Opent the website > Check proxy tab	
		- In the target we can see the structure view of Website
		- It used the capture the link where we go and it will show in structure view in target tab
	ii) Scope:-  We can test the particular website 
		- It is easy to spidering
		- Website(app.networrk.in) > right click Add to scope 
	iii) Spider:- crawling the links internally
		-> Passive spidering - Update the site without sending request
	 	      - Almost saving the duplicate request of the site
		-> Form Submission - Automatically assign the HTML form fileds value
	iv) Application Login:- We can enter the login credentials if we know but only for one form or  multiple form
		- We can check the respose of particular JS in new tab > right click and show response in browser

C) Sequencer and scanner:-
	i) Sequencer:- Calculate the randomness of String,token,data,URI or check the common things
		- Goto Proxy > display proxy put into sequencer
		- once add in sequencer then goto "SEQUENCER" 	
		i) Select live capture request is automatically added
		ii) Token within response we get automarically  "COOKIE"  it shows directly or easy way to use  custome cookie
		under the set cookie  
		ii) Start live capture
		iv) Stop token capture > Analyze it is good,poor,excellent > copy token and paste into blank file
		v) We can test on cookies security
	ii) Scanner only in enterprises mode

D) Repeater:-
	- We can add into "REPEATER" and check the "RESPONSE" that we get 
	- We can change "REQUEST" as per tester side

E) Intuder and Comparer
	i) Intuder:- 
		- It is automated fuzzing	
		- Intruder attacks on payload (Position) 
		- For eg. Login fields 	we put user name - suraj9110@gmail.com and password should entered wrong.
		- When its capture then > Send to the Intruder and set the attacks 
		- Goto > Intruder tab > goto Positions > They are automatically highlights fuzz position (Payloads) that we can fuzz
		- There are four types of attack :
		1) Sniper:- 	
		- In this no. of highlights fields test to no of payload. (For eg. password > We have 8 strings they will test into no.highlights fields each and every position "8 x no.position")
		2) Battering Ram:-
		- In this only one string can be test at a time for no. of highlighted position
		3) Pitchfork:-
		- In this when we goto "PAYLOAD" tab they are showing the list of highlighted position that we can provide different list of strings	
		4) Cluster Bomb:-
		-  In this they can try permutation and combination
		
		>Clear the highlighted position > select the position which we wants to fuzz > and Click on "ÄDD"  button (For example - "password" position)
		> When select "Simple List" payload types and enter the combination of data or we can provide external list
		> "Add from list" this only for (Proversion Only), in this we have predefined password script list  like SQL injection scripting, Cross-site scripting

		- Payload Processign > We can set the payload processing rules
		- "Option" tab > Request Header > Already checked 
		- "Option" tab > Request Engine > only for "Pro version only" we can set the speed of request engine
		-  Click on > Start Attack
		- Once find the attack pop-up > Check the length > different length > Click right click > send to compare (Response) one is differnet and one is base request(wrong)
		- "Regix" is the regular expression of the password for example A@13**
