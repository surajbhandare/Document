A) In browser only "GET" method use

B) GET method for only request

C) In browser POST method does not work because we can only entered 

D) https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/#patch (For the Reading)

E) 200 - Ok
     404 - Page not found
     500 - Internal Server error 
     400 - Bad Request 
     202 - Handshake Request

F) Methods of API Security Testing 
	1) Fuzz Testing :- (Anything we can enter)
		- It is one of the simple and common ways to test the delicacies in a web service.
		- It is basically a black box software testing technique which includes finding bugs using malformed data injection.
		- You can simply use the command lines like curl and simply send some unexpected value to API and check if it breaks.	
		- For example: {Text (Command Line)}
	
	2) Fuzz Testing Numbers :- (We can enter Negative and positive number)
		- If your API expects numbers in the input, try to send values such as (negative numbers, 0, and large digit numbers).
		- For example: {Password (0-1,33333333333)} 

	3) Fuzz Testing Strings :- (We can enter SQL Queries) 
		- The best way of fuzz testing strings is to send SQL queries in a criterion 
		- API will not run any SQL sent is a request
		- For example: {Password (select * from user where id = "1"; )} 		
		- API by entering a command  ?command=rm -rf / within one of the query parameter.
			A)  https://example.com/delete?name=file.txt;rm%20/
			B) SQL in API parameters :- 
				- $name = $_GET[‘username’]; 
				   runDbTransaction(“UPDATE user SET username=$name WHERE id = …”)
	
	4) Test Unhandled HTTP Methods :- 
		- API that uses HTTP have various methods that are used to retrieve, save and delete data.
	
	5) Parameter Tampering :-
		- It takes the advantage of backend sanitizing errors and then manipulates parameters sent in API requests.
		- use ( type=”hidden” ) input should always be tested in order to make sure that backend server correctly validates them.\
		- For Example :- <input type=”hidden” name=”price” value=”100.00? />

G) Input :- 
	1. Use the proper HTTP method according to the operation :- 
		- GET (read), 
		- POST (create), 
		- PUT/PATCH (replace/update), 
		- DELETE (to delete a record), and respond with 405 Method Not Allowed if the requested method isn't appropriate for the requested resource.
 	
	2. Validate content-type on request Accept header (Content Negotiation) to allow only your supported format (e.g. application/xml, application/json, etc.) and respond with 406 Not 	Acceptable response if not matched.
 	3. Validate content-type of posted data as you accept (e.g. application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, application/json, etc.).
 	4. Validate user input to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS, SQL-Injection, Remote Code Execution, etc.).
 	5. Don't use any sensitive data (credentials, Passwords, security tokens, or API keys) in the URL, but use standard Authorization header.
	6. Use an API Gateway service to enable caching, Rate Limit policies (e.g. Quota, Spike Arrest, or Concurrent Rate Limit) and deploy APIs resources dynamically.
